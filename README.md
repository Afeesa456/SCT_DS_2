# 🛳 Titanic Data Analysis (EDA)

This project analyzes the **Titanic dataset** using Python. The goal is to clean the data, handle missing values, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand survival patterns.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Dataset**: Titanic dataset (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, `gender_submission.csv`)
- **Steps performed**:
  1. Data Cleaning  
     - Filled missing `Age` with **median**  
     - Filled missing `Embarked` with **mode**  
     - Verified missing values were handled  
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
     - Survival count  
     - Survival by gender  
     - Survival by passenger class  
     - Age distribution by survival  
     - Fare distribution by survival

## 📊 Visualizations
### 1. Survival Count
Shows overall survival vs. non-survival counts.  

### 2. Survival by Gender
Shows how survival rates differ between males and females.  

### 3. Survival by Passenger Class
Shows survival rates across passenger classes (1st, 2nd, 3rd).  

### 4. Age Distribution by Survival
Comparison of age distribution between survived and not survived passengers.  

### 5. Fare Distribution by Survival
Comparison of fare paid by survived vs. not survived passengers.
